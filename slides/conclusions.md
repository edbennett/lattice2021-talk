# Conclusions

-

## Summary

* Most ratios remain flat
* Scalar glueball remains lightest state
* Tensor-scalar glueball ratio falls short of gauge-gravity model predictions
* Topological susceptibility very close to quenched, $N_{\mathsf{f}}=2$ data
* $\gamma_*$ decreases as $\beta$ increases
* Results poorly described by chiral perturbation theory

-

## Possibile interpretations

* QCD-like, but probed with too large $am$
  * Inconsistent with observed mass hierarchy
* Conformal, with scaling deviations
* Conformal, but strongly influenced by bulk phase

-

## Ongoing work

* Smaller $am$:
  * To verify observed behaviour continues
* Larger $\beta$:
  * To stabilise approach to continuum
  * To probe scaling deviations
* Domain Wall Fermion action:
  * To reduce lattice artefacts towards chiral limit
